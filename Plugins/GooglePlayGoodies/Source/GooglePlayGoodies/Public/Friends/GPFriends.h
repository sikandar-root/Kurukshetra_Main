	* This is all encapsulated in the API to make requesting access and subsequently using the friends list a straightforward task.
	* 
	* @param PageSize - The number of entries to request for this initial page. Note that if cached data already exists, the returned buffer may contain more than this size, but it is guaranteed to contain at least this many if the collection contains enough records.
	* @param ForceReload - If true, this call will clear any locally-cached data and attempt to fetch the latest data from the server. This would commonly be used for something like a user-initiated refresh. Normally, this should be set to false to gain advantages of data caching.
	* @param OnSuccess - Called if load friends is successfull
	* @param OnFailure - Called if load friends is failed
